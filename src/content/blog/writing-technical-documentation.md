Good technical documentation is crucial for any software project. Here's how to write documentation that helps rather than frustrates.

## Key Principles

1. **Know Your Audience**
   - Who are you writing for?
   - What is their technical level?
   - What are they trying to achieve?

2. **Structure Matters**
   - Use clear headings and subheadings
   - Keep paragraphs focused and concise
   - Include examples where helpful

## Code Examples

Here's an example of well-documented code:

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the sum of an array of numbers
 * @param {number[]} numbers - Array of numbers to sum
 * @returns {number} The sum of all numbers in the array
 */
function sum(numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
}
```

## Best Practices

- Keep it up to date
- Use consistent terminology
- Include practical examples
- Provide context when needed
- Review and revise regularly
